> **My take on the classic pacman arcade game.**

If the player eats special flashing food the ghosts start to flash and can now be captured by the player, sending them back to their holding pen, from where they can once again start to hunt the player.

The aim is to achieve the highest score possible before being killed by the ghosts.

### Key Functionality
1. Ghost "intelligence"
 - Ghost movement modes (normal and obstacle navigation mode)
 - Ghost target switching. They switch between the ghost's home area and Pacman
 - Ghost bias inversion. When Pacman eats a big pill, the ghosts usual bias towards Pacman (or their home) is inverted so they flee
